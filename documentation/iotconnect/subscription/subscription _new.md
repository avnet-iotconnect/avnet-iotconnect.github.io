# IoTConnect Subscription Information

## Plan Types  

IoTConnect is available for Personal and Business usage with tiered usage plans.  Personal plans are a Software-as-a-Serivce (SaaS) and hosted on either Azure or AWS.  Plans range from $30 to $300 based on Messages, Devices, Users and premium connectors to other underlying services.  Businesses may leverage IoTConnect as either a SaaS model or as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model hosted on existing infrastructure.  Business interested in learning more should contact their regional Avnet representative or leverage the "Contact Us" button on the [IoTConnect Subscription Site](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe).

## Supported Clouds  

IoTConnect may be deployed on either Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS.  This is espcially beneficial if there is existing infrastructure with a specific cloud provider or other preferences.  Both Personal and Business accounts may choose the underlying cloud platform. 

## Free Trial  

A 2 month "Test Drive" trial plan is available through the [IoTConnect Subscription](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe) page.  This version allows up to 5 devices, 5 users, and 30K messages per month, and does not require a credit card for registration.

## Avnet Employees  

Avnet and affliated employees should contact the IoT team for their account information.
